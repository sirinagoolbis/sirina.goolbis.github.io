# Hi, I'm Sirina ðŸ‘‹
**Data Scientist** | NLP & LLMs | Security Analytics  

I'm a data scientist and aspiring AI researcher with a focus on NLP, applied machine learning, and foundation model fine-tuning. I work on projects that transcribe on structured data into actionable insights - including BERT-based Resume classify, behavioral analytics from real-world security data and threat profiling using the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

This portfolio highlights my work across data sceince, machine learning, and cybersecurity, with an emphasis on building scalable,human-focused solutions. I am particulary focused on applying these skills in cloud-based environments like Azure.

Key Areas:
- Data visualization, optimization, and ML model evaluation
- Behavioral Data Analysis & Security Intelligence
- Natural Language Processing (BERT, RoBERTa, Hugging Face Transformers)
- Azure AI & SC-900 Security certification (in progress)
